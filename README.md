Just a simple Grades App (Beginner)

Platform: Android;
Language: Java;
Database: SQLite;
IDE: Android Studio;

This is an App where you only have one activity that handles everything.
The right ListView is a list of modules you are currently enrolled in and the right one lists all the grades you accuired
in that module.

The Min Note (Grade) calculates the minimum grade needed to pass that module (Set this to your schools/country specs).
The End Note (Grade) gives you the calculated grade of the module if you set the percentages right.

As you can see this in German and I don't have the time to translate it into English.

I now know that I should've used a better gitignore for my personal config files but it's done. I'm sorry :)
Importing the project into Android Studio should do the thing, you can then hack away and optimize.
